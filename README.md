## ‚≠êAbstract

### Introduction

In the dynamic landscape of the music industry, hit songs not only reflect musical innovation but also echo cultural changes over time. This visualization project meticulously documents the evolution of popular music from 2000 to 2019. Through a series of insightful visualizations, we illustrate changes in the popularity of different genres, the rise and fall of artists, and the distinguishing characteristics of hit songs from one year to the next. Our goal is to illuminate patterns of musical dominance and evolution, providing users with an interactive exploration of hit songs through engaging visual representations.

### Problem Statement

Our objective is to identify shifts in preferences for song styles and genres across different years, thereby enabling songwriters and listeners to deepen their understanding of musical trends. While our initial goal included a focus on lyrical content, our research has evolved to more comprehensively explore changes in song styles and genres. This refined approach allows our investigation to become more focused and in-depth. With our data visualization, we aim to answer the following questions:

- How have musical genres evolved over the last two decades?
- Which artists dominated the music scene in various years?
- What are the defining characteristics and genres of music that resonate with audiences, and how do they change over time?

### Dataset

The dataset "Top Hits Spotify from 2000-2019" provides comprehensive information for about 2000 songs, offering a rich resource for analyzing the music industry. Each entry in the dataset contains:

- Artist's name
- Song title
- Release year
- Musical features such as danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, genre, and tempo (BPM).

This dataset, popular on Kaggle, contains no NaN values, minimizing the need for extensive cleaning.
